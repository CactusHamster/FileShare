# FileShare
 The best file sharing program ever, because it took forever to make. It also was slapped together really quickly.
# How to run
Download the repo and find the file webserver.js, also make sure you have nodejs installed.  
Now just type 'node index.js', also please realize this is not the most secure program in the world, don't expect me to make it more secure in the future.
# How to use
In chrome/any other browser type 'localhost:8080', if you are already using port 8080 you will have to modify the port to something else.  
Now to share files you can use type the internal ip of your computer on another computer to connect, for anybody else to use it you'll have to figure out something like ngrok.
